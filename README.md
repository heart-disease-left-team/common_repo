McNulty and Associates Insurance Co., Inc.

Overall Goals:
The McNulty and Associates data science team has built several predictive models to better understand the risk faced by our customers of developing coronary heart disease.  The main purpose in building these models was to identify which data points are the principal predictors of coronary heart disease, and to use these models to survey demographic data from different regions of the USA / world to assess heart disease risk.
This information will enable us to better understand both the questions to ask and the tests to perform to best assess an individualâ€™s risk of coronary heart disease. This will lead to increased efficiency in our data collection techniques and improve our ability to accurately assess the overall risk of insuring the individual.

Agenda:

Kate Thompson will be exploring whether demographic/lifestyle information can be used to accurately assess heart disease risk.

Trevor Bedrin will be investigating the subset of medical diagnostic tools that are the most effective principal predictors of coronary heart disease and will be reporting on the accuracy of the resulting model.

Jeremie Cohen, will be studying the evolution of the lifestyle (nutrition, tobacco use etc...) these last twenty years and determine what are the behavioral factors that have had the greatest impact on heart diseases.

Ian Crane will be investigating whether it is feasible to assess future heart disease risk based on the development of other serious medical conditions by patients.

Jeff Cheng, will be assessing heart disease risk in different regions of the United States to identify high-risk regions.
